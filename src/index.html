  Pyronica is a fire organ, that is, a pipe organ that voices with propane instead of air (or steam for a calliope).  It has three 12-note octaves and plays from any MIDI source, usually a keyboard.  As far as we know, this is the first fire organ that can be played as a musical instrument.  We would love to <a class="yellow" href="/get_involved/">collaborate</a> with you on making Pyronica bigger and better, or help you leverage what we've learned to make yours better.  <a class="yellow" href="/contact_us">Let us know what you think!</a>
